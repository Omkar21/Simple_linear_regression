I have completed the "Machine Learning : A-Z" course delivered on udemy platform.
In this project, I have implemented the simple linear regression model to predict the salaries as per the years of experience.
Following Python libraries used for implementation:
1. Pandas - for data preprocessing.
2. Numpy - for data preprocessing.
3. sklearn - to implement the linear regression model.
4. matplotlib - to plot the results
